## Test application with all the good bits

Clone this repo: [TODO](TODO)

If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to install all the dependencies:

```
$> npm install
```

A bunch of security vulnerabilities will be reported. DO NOT PANIC. You can learn more here, but we will mostly just ignore these for now.

Anyway, now you can run the app:

```
$> npm run
```

After a minute, a website will pop up.
