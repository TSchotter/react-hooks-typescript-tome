# Chapter 5 - Complex Representations

[&laquo; Return to the Table of Contents](../index.md)

The time has finally come to weave everything together. TypeScript and React Hooks must be joined in order to achieve our true destiny: medium-sized interactive web applications with a beautiful hierarchy of components.

In the first section, we'll first go over Firebase to get you connected to a functioning database to communicate with as well as getting the testing enviornment set up with an emulator
so that you can test in peace.

In the second section, we'll look at some more complex examples of state where we have a collection of objects that can be edited, added, and removed.

Then, we will walk through a much larger application with multiple levels of nested state. Like a conductor leading a symphonic orchestra, you will see how we pass state around between components. Because I guess conductors pass the music around? IDK I'm just a book. Go read the chapter.
