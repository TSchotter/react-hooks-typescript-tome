## The Problem with JavaScript

Its type system is madness! Things are very inconsistent and surprising. It's super easy to make mistakes that will take forever to debug. When you're writing JavaScript, things will be a little crazy.

That's why we're going to be using TypeScript instead. TypeScript adds static types to JavaScript. That means when you declare a variable, you say what type of value it holds. The variable cannot hold other kinds of values. Similarly, when you define a function, you say what type of values it takes as parameters and what type of value it returns.
