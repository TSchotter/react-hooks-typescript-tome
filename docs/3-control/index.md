# Control Flow

* Basics of TypeScript
  * Basic types
  * Arrays, Interfaces, Nested Data
  * Map/Filter/Reduce/Every/All, `for` loops
  * DO NOT USE `for` and `while` loops
  * If statements, ternary `?` expressions
  * Tests: Monster mash exercises, rendered results in react. Test cases prove that they succeeded. Demand they use map, filter, and reduce rather than for loops. Just a subset tho, some are examples and some are problems. Gives a nice chance to cover types, pure functions, loops, conditionals, and other basics.
