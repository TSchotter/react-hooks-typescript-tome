# Basic Application

You should have already installed and run the starter application. This is the base.

## What is a web application?

### What is a website?

### What is HTML?

### What is CSS?

### What is Bootstrap?

### What is JavaScript?

The programming language of the web.

### What is TypeScript?

A modified version of JavaScript that adds in strict **static** typing. TypeScript compiles into JavaScript.

### What is JSX/TSX?

A modified version of JavaScript (JSX) or TypeScript (TSX) that allows you to embed HTML directly into the code.

## Editing HTML

Make some tweaks to the HTML content of the page. View the changes in the browser.

1. Fill in a paragraph of text.
2. Create a list.
3. Make a link to some other site.
4. Add in an image.

## Passing Tests

Run:

```sh
$> npm run test
```

If you are failing the first N tests, then we need to fix them.

## Editing CSS

1. Make some text bigger
2. Change the background color
3. Put an icon in the page
4. Float the image, put padding and border around the image

## Making a Button

1. Make a Bootstrap Button
2. Console log a message when you press the button
3. Testing a button (provide an example test, then have them make their own too)

* JS API stuff: Time/date, random, maybe fetch, vibrate, barcode detection, camera, geolocation, sensor API, speech, web cryptography.
