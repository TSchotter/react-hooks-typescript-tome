# Introduction

Okay, so let's actually mess with our web application.

# Editing HTML

Make some tweaks to the HTML content of the page. View the changes in the browser.

## Headers

```tsx
<h1>This is header text</h1>
```

1. Fill in a paragraph of text.
2. Create a list.
3. Make a link to some other site.
4. Add in an image.

## Passing Tests

Run:

```sh
$> npm run test
```

If you are failing the first N tests, then we need to fix them.

## Editing CSS

1. Make some text bigger
2. Change the background color
3. Put an icon in the page
4. Float the image, put padding and border around the image

## Making a Button

1. Make a Bootstrap Button
2. Console log a message when you press the button
3. Testing a button (provide an example test, then have them make their own too)

* JS API stuff: Time/date, random, maybe fetch, vibrate, barcode detection, camera, geolocation, sensor API, speech, web cryptography.
